    <h3 style="text-align: center" id="alltitle">SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?</h3>
    <p id="bodytext">There are 3 main problems in the restaurant industry that affect customers: (1) Waiting for the waiter, (2) Hiring/training staff, (3) Customers don't know what they are getting. These days, customers at restaurants should really be called Waiters, because they do more waiting than the actual waiters. Additionally, 43% of restaurant owners find that hiring and training staff is the biggest challenge because of costs and time. This does affect you, because with these added costs, the price of menu items increases. Lastly, we have all looked in the menu and saw amazing pictures of the different meal items, but when we order, what comes looks very, VERY different. These problems will soon become a thing of the past...</p>

    <h3 style="text-align: center" id="alltitle">WHAT'S OUR SOLUTION?</h3>
    <p id="bodytext">With MyMenu. MyMenu a digital menu system installed on tablet that replaces the traditional paper menu. When you walk into a restaurant, the waitress would hand each person one of these digital menus and take everyone to their seats. Customers would be able to see all the different items that the restaurant sells, as well as create an account and add in payment information. Ordering will be possible from MyMenu and this would eliminate the need of waiters and instead replace them with "Food Runners." These food runners would go back and forth between tables with anything that customers order. They would also provide assistance for customers. There will no longer be long periods of time between customers wanting something and their waiter walking past their table, as summoning the Food Runners would be as simple as clicking a button.</p>
