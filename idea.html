    <p id="description">MyMenu is a digital menu system installed on tablet that replaces the traditional paper menu. When you walk into a restaurant, the waitress would hand each person one of these digital menus and take everyone to their seats. Customers would be able to see all the different items that the restaurant sells, as well as create an account and add in payment information. Ordering will be possible from MyMenu and this would eliminate the need of waiters and instead replace them with "Food Runners." These food runners would go back and forth between tables with anything that customers order. They would also provide assistance for customers. There will no longer be long periods of time between customers wanting something and their waiter walking past their table, as summoning the Food Runners would be as simple as clicking a button.</p>
