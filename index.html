	  <p id="zimdescription">I grew up on my family farm for the first 12 years of my life. Lake fishing, deep sea fishing, camping, rock climbing, and animal watching are just a few of the many different activites that I enjoyed with my family and friends. Once we even stayed on a house boat for a few weeks and swam in a lake full of crocodiles. On one of our fishing trips, my brother caught a 3 foot Tiger Fish, which has sharp, 1 inch long teeth. At one wilde life preserve, I even got to stroke a Lion! These and many more adventures composed my early life and influenced who I have become today.</p>
